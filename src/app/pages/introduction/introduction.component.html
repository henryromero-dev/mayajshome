    MayaJS is a new way to rapidly develop powerful server-side applications. We call it the "no-code backend builder."

    MayaJS empowers you to create fully functional backend systems, complete with databases and APIs. It streamlines the creation of essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with advanced features like filtering, pagination, and sorting.
